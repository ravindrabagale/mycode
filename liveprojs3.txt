1) create directory named "uploads" in html folder.

sudo mkdir uploads

2) Assign write permissions to uploads directory

sudo chmod -R 777 uploads



3) create one bucket in s3 with ACL-enabled Setting, remove block all setting of bucket. (i.e. public -eadAccess)


4) create one file named "fileadd.html" in html folder

5) Add below code to fileadd.html file

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <form action="ups3.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            Select image to upload:
            <input type="file" name="anyfile" id="anyfile">
                <input type="submit" value="Upload Image" name="submit">
        </form>
        
    </body>
</html>


6) run below commands step by step in html folder

 sudo php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
 sudo php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55ce33d7678c5a611085589f1f3ddf8b3c52d662cd01d4ba75c0ee0459970c2200a51f492d557530c71c15d8dba01eae') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
 sudo php composer-setup.php
 sudo php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
 

 sudo php  composer.phar require aws/aws-sdk-php


//sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer     use this command if got any error

Note: here first "composer" gets installed on your ec2 and then composer installs AWS-SDK for PHP. 
we uses AWS-SDK to do AWS work through coding.

7)create file named ups3.php in html folder

8) Add below code to ups3.php


<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Aws\S3\S3Client;
// Instantiate an Amazon S3 client.
$s3Client = new S3Client([
'version' => 'latest',
'region'  => 'ap-south-1',
'credentials' => [
'key'    => '***********',     //Add your access key here
'secret' => '**************'  //Add your secret key here
]
]);
// Check if the form was submitted
if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"){
// Check if file was uploaded without errors
if(isset($_FILES["anyfile"]) && $_FILES["anyfile"]["error"] == 0){
$allowed = array("jpg" => "image/jpg", "jpeg" => "image/jpeg", "gif" => "image/gif", "png" => "image/png");
$filename = $_FILES["anyfile"]["name"];
$filetype = $_FILES["anyfile"]["type"];
$filesize = $_FILES["anyfile"]["size"];
// Validate file extension
$ext = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
if(!array_key_exists($ext, $allowed)) die("Error: Please select a valid file format.");
// Validate file size - 10MB maximum
$maxsize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
if($filesize > $maxsize) die("Error: File size is larger than the allowed limit.");
// Validate type of the file
if(in_array($filetype, $allowed)){
// Check whether file exists before uploading it
if(file_exists("uploads/" . $filename)){
echo $filename . " is already exists.";
} else{
if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["anyfile"]["tmp_name"], "uploads/" . $filename)){
$bucket = '*********';              //Add your bucket name here
$file_Path = __DIR__ . '/uploads/'. $filename;
$key = basename($file_Path);
try {
$result = $s3Client->putObject([
'Bucket' => $bucket,
'Key'    => $key,
'Body'   => fopen($file_Path, 'r'),
'ACL'    => 'public-read', // make file 'public'
]);
echo "Image uploaded successfully. Image path is: ". $result->get('ObjectURL');
} catch (Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception $e) {
echo "There was an error uploading the file.\n";
echo $e->getMessage();
}
echo "Your file was uploaded successfully.";
}else{
echo "File is not uploaded";
}
} 
} else{
echo "Error: There was a problem uploading your file. Please try again."; 
}
} else{
echo "Error: " . $_FILES["anyfile"]["error"];
}
}
?>


9) Replace all *** values with your values..
  get Access Key and secret key from your account's Security Credentials.
  get bucketname from S3. (Make sure bucket is created with ACL-enabled Settings)

10) Now open below url in browser
 http://your ip address/fileadd.html

now click on "browse" button and select any one image and click on "upload"

11) Now it must show image uploaded successfully and also need to show you s3 url for ur image

12) Go to uploads folder in html folder and check that image also uploaded here
